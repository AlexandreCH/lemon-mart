## Router-first Approach
A router-first approach to SPA design will save development teams, large and small, significant waste in duplicative work, and re-architecting of the code base to enable better collaboration or achieve sub-second first meaningful paints in your application.

In order to pull off a router-first implementation, you need to:
1. Define user roles and a site-map early on,
2. Design with lazy loading in mind, leveraging router outlets, auxiliary paths and smart link tracking,
3. Implement a walking-skeleton navigation experience and validate, allowing multiple teams to execute seamlessly,
4. Design around major data components, using stateless data-driven components using RxJS/BehaviorSubjects,
5. Be disciplined in sticking to a decoupled component architecture, allowing remixing the UX quickly to respond to changes in requirements without having to re-architect the codebase,
6. Differentiate between user controls and components to appropriate use binding, resolve and auth guards,
7. With TypeScript classes, interfaces, enums, validators and pipes maximize code reuse


## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `-prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).
